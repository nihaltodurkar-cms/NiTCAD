# NiTCAD — Decisions awaiting review

**Status: Q1–Q5, Q10 and Q11 ACCEPTED by the owner on 2026-10-02** ("I like opus decision go ahead and start") and
recorded in `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 14.1. The new questions N1–N7 and the inconsistency list below were **not**
explicitly ruled on: N1–N4 are applied as provisional Unit 1 defaults (14.2), N5–N7 stay open (14.5).

Source: an Opus subagent (medium effort, read-only) was given `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the questions on 2026-10-02.
I (Claude Sonnet 5.5) have not independently verified its factual claims beyond what is marked. Claims that came from
secondary web sources, or that nobody ran, are marked **[unverified]**.

Already decided and not repeated here: D1–D6, D8, R1, R4, Q6–Q9 (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` 14.1–14.3).

## Summary

| # | Question | Recommendation | Needed before |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Namespace nesting and include casing | `NiTCAD::<layer>`; `include/NiTCAD/<layer>/` | Unit 1 |
| Q2 | Programmer-error preconditions | Always-on `NITCAD_EXPECTS` macro, fail-fast, never throws | Unit 2 |
| Q3 | vcpkg source; presets and CI in Unit 1 | Pinned standalone vcpkg; `CMakePresets.json` in Unit 1; CI later | Unit 1 |
| Q4 | `Error` categories and shape | `enum class ErrorCode` (7 values) + `struct Error` with optional context | Unit 2 |
| Q5 | Test-only second backend in Unit 3 | No; prove neutrality with a header-boundary build check and interface-only tests | Unit 3 |
| Q10 | CI toolset and cache design | GitHub-hosted Windows runner, `vcvars_ver` selection, assert exact versions, `files` binary cache | CI unit |
| Q11 | Move to an LTS toolset | Trigger on 14.52 LTS release, migrate within 60 days, re-run V1/V4 | 14.52 release |

## Q1 — Namespace nesting and include-root casing

- **Recommendation:** Nest each layer as `NiTCAD::<layer>`. Use `include/NiTCAD/<layer>/`, spelled exactly like the namespace.
- **Why:**
  - Nesting prevents name clashes and ADL surprises between layers (for example `mesh::Node` vs a future `render::Node`; `linalg::Matrix` vs an Eigen or D3D matrix).
  - Nesting lets a later check enforce the layer table (section 3) by namespace.
  - Windows ignores case, so the risk is consistency, not function. One spelling avoids an include that works locally and breaks on a case-sensitive checkout or cache.
  - Mixed case matches the decided root namespace.
- **Rejected:** a flat `NiTCAD` namespace (loses the layer boundary); lowercase `include/nitcad/` (a second spelling with no benefit on Windows).
- **Risks:** Git `core.ignorecase=true` can hide case-only renames, so settle the casing before any file exists.
- **Needed before:** Unit 1.
- **Owner decision:** [x] accept (2026-10-02)  [ ] change  [ ] defer

## Q2 — Enforcing programmer-error preconditions

- **Recommendation:** One project macro, `NITCAD_EXPECTS(cond)`. Always on in debug and release. On violation it logs file, line and condition, then calls `std::abort` or `__fastfail`. It never throws.
- **Why:**
  - Fits R1: no exceptions in hot kernels. The check costs one predictable branch.
  - A violated precondition is a bug, not a state to recover from; throwing invites catch-and-continue.
  - Always on keeps loud failure (6.7). A separate debug-only assert can be added later for expensive invariants.
  - Catch2 has no death tests, so preconditions are tested by testing the predicate functions directly. A test-only option routing the handler to a throwing hook is possible; keep it out of shipped builds.
- **Rejected:** exceptions (contradict R1, blur bug vs error); `assert` (disabled by `NDEBUG`); bare `std::terminate` (loses the diagnostic).
- **Risks:** C++26 contracts may later replace the macro, so keep it thin. `__fastfail` vs `abort` under a debugger **[unverified]**: not tested.
- **Needed before:** Unit 2.
- **Owner decision:** [x] accept (2026-10-02)  [ ] change  [ ] defer

## Q3 — vcpkg source; `CMakePresets.json` and CI in Unit 1

- **Recommendation:** Use a standalone vcpkg tool checkout pinned to a recorded tag or commit. Put `CMakePresets.json` in Unit 1. Keep the CI workflow out of Unit 1; add it as its own owner-named unit after Q10 is designed.
- **Why:**
  - The manifest baseline pins port versions, not the vcpkg tool. The Visual Studio-bundled tool changes with every Visual Studio update, and CI cannot assume the same copy.
  - A preset is the one place that sets generator, toolchain file, triplet, `/std:c++23preview` and `/options:strict`. Without it every developer and CI job retypes them. This is not speculative.
  - A CI workflow before the cache and toolset design exists would be speculative.
- **Rejected:** bundled vcpkg only (drifts, not reproducible on CI); vcpkg as a git submodule (adds a full vcpkg tree to the owner-controlled file tree).
- **Risks:** the standalone checkout is **[unverified]**. V2 only tested the Visual Studio-bundled one, so V2 must be re-run with a standalone checkout before Unit 1.
- **Needed before:** Unit 1 (vcpkg choice, presets). CI later.
- **Owner decision:** [x] accept (2026-10-02)  [ ] change  [ ] defer

## Q4 — `Error` categories and shape

- **Recommendation:**
  ```text
  enum class ErrorCode : std::uint8_t {
      invalid_input, degenerate_mesh, singular_system,
      inaccurate_solve, non_convergence, cancelled, resource_exhausted };
  struct Error { ErrorCode code; std::string message; std::optional<ErrorContext> context; };
  ```
  `ErrorContext` is small and plain: an optional index (node, edge, row or bias step) and an optional numeric value (residual or tolerance).
- **Why:**
  - Callers branch on the code; people read the message.
  - Typed numeric context keeps the diagnostics required by 6.10 item 4 without formatting strings inside kernels.
  - `resource_exhausted` covers an out-of-memory factorization that a backend converts at its boundary (6.7).
  - No "internal" category: internal bugs go through Q2.
- **Rejected:** `std::error_code` and categories (more machinery, string-centric); splitting `invalid_input` per layer (premature).
- **Risks:** `std::string` allocates on the error path. Acceptable because it never runs on the success path, but say so in the document.
- **Needed before:** Unit 2.
- **Owner decision:** [x] accept (2026-10-02)  [ ] change  [ ] defer

## Q5 — Test-only second backend in Unit 3

- **Recommendation:** Do not add a second backend. Prove backend neutrality with (a) a CMake test that compiles the public `linalg` headers in a translation unit with **no Eigen include path**, so any leak of an Eigen type into the interface fails the build, and (b) behavioural tests written only against the interface.
- **Why:**
  - It checks the boundary mechanically.
  - Interface-only tests run unchanged against any future backend.
  - A test-only dense or mock solver would be a speculative file the feature freeze forbids, and it proves little about PARDISO-style symbolic reuse.
- **Rejected:** a test-only dense or mock backend.
- **Risks:** whether one interface fits both direct and iterative backends stays unproven until one is requested.
- **Needed before:** Unit 3.
- **Owner decision:** [x] accept (2026-10-02)  [ ] change  [ ] defer

## Q10 — CI toolset provisioning and vcpkg binary cache

- **Recommendation:** GitHub-hosted Windows runner. Select the toolset with `vcvarsall.bat x64 -vcvars_ver=14.51`. Fail the job unless `cl` reports 19.51.36260, the SDK is 10.0.26100.0, CMake is 4.3.1 and Ninja is 1.13.2. Cache vcpkg binaries with the `files` binary source pointed at a directory saved by `actions/cache`, keyed on baseline + triplet + toolset version + `vcpkg.json` hash.
- **Why:**
  - Exact image contents cannot be pinned on hosted runners; asserting versions turns drift into a loud failure.
  - If the exact toolset is missing, the fallbacks are a self-hosted runner or a step that installs the component with the Visual Studio Installer CLI (slow).
  - The `files` source works with any cache backend.
- **Rejected:** vcpkg `x-gha` (believed removed after GitHub's cache-service change, **[unverified]**); NuGet on GitHub Packages (needs tokens and a feed; revisit if cache size limits bite).
- **Risks / unverified:**
  - Secondary sources say GitHub moved `windows-latest`/`windows-2025` to Visual Studio 2026 in June 2026 ([scivision](https://www.scivision.dev/github-actions-vs-2026), [byteiota](https://byteiota.com/github-actions-windows-vs2026-migration/)). **[unverified]**
  - **Not checked:** whether that image contains MSVC 14.51.36231 exactly, SDK 26100, CMake 4.3.1 or Ninja 1.13.2. The bundled CMake probably differs, so CMake and Ninja would be pinned separately (checksummed download or a pinned action).
  - `-vcvars_ver=14.51` selection on a runner has not been run. Hosted images update weekly, so the patch level may move.
- **Needed before:** the CI unit (not Unit 1).
- **Owner decision:** [x] accept (2026-10-02)  [ ] change  [ ] defer

## Q11 — Moving to an LTS toolset

- **Recommendation:** Trigger on general availability of MSVC 14.52 LTS (expected November 2026). Migrate within 60 days, and well before the derived end of 14.51 support (about February 2027).
- **Why:**
  - The project needs years of stability. 14.50 LTS was never tested here.
  - If 14.52 ships a stable `/std:c++23`, switch from `/std:c++23preview` at the same time.
- **Re-verification steps (one dedicated branch):**
  1. Re-run V1 (feature macros and probe program).
  2. Re-run V4 (configure gate, D9002 / `/options:strict` behaviour, Eigen 5.0.1 and Catch2 3.16.0 from the pinned baseline).
  3. Run the full test suite.
  4. Update the CI version assertions and cache key.
  5. Record the result in `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 12.
- **Rejected:** moving to 14.50 now (untested); staying on 14.51 past end of support.
- **Risks:** the 14.52 release date and its C++23 completeness are **[unverified]**. `_MSVC_LANG` under a stable flag may differ from 202302L, so the gate must accept the new value deliberately.
- **Needed before:** 14.52 release, and before 14.51 end of support.
- **Owner decision:** [x] accept (2026-10-02)  [ ] change  [ ] defer

## New questions the advisor raised (not yet in `ARCHITECTURE.md`)

None of these is decided. Each needs an owner position before the build scaffold fixes the flags.

| # | Question | Needed before |
|---|---|---|
| N1 | Runtime library: pin `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` to match `x64-windows-static-md` (dynamic CRT, `/MD`). It is unstated. | Unit 1 |
| N2 | Floating-point model: `/fp:precise` vs `/fp:strict`, and `/arch:AVX2` or not. This affects the tolerance-based reproducibility in 6.8. | Unit 1 |
| N3 | Exception flag: `/EHsc` is needed because Eigen and the standard library can throw. State it. | Unit 1 |
| N4 | Windows headers: define `UNICODE`/`_UNICODE`, use `/utf-8`, and define `NOMINMAX`/`WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` before `windows.h` reaches any code. | Unit 1 (core), L7/L8 (app) |
| N5 | Whether both Debug and Release builds run the tests in CI. | CI unit |
| N6 | Licence. NiTCAD stays MIT (`LICENSE`), as the owner stated with Unit 18 (2026-10-08). Eigen (MPL-2.0) is compiled into the binaries: a release must carry its notice and MPL source terms. Intel MKL (Unit 18) is an optional, separately licensed external dependency (Intel Simplified Software License): NiTCAD loads it at run time from a path the user gives and never links or ships it; bundling MKL with a release would need its licence and notices handled explicitly. | release notices before release |
| N7 | Whether clang-format, `/analyze` or clang-tidy are wanted at all, given "no speculative files". | owner |

## Inconsistencies the advisor found in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (not yet fixed)

These are the advisor's reading; I have not re-checked each against the file. I believe the first three are correct from
my own edits.

1. **Unit 1 gate list.** Section 11 says Unit 1 waits for "V1, V2 and V3". V4 also exists, and V3 (scaling) is consumed at Unit 7, not Unit 1.
2. **V2 row.** V2 was run under `-std:c++latest`, which Q6 rejects. V4 covers the decided flag, but the V2 row reads as if it were current.
3. **Q10 vs section 8.** Q10 says "Unit 1, or when CI is created", while section 8 keeps CI out of the structure until approved. One of them should win.
4. **Warning policy.** Section 9 says warnings are errors, but V4 used `/W4` without `/WX`. The exact flags for Unit 1 are not stated.
5. **Thread count** appears both as a backend option and as a separate item in 6.10 (item 3 and item 5). Minor duplication.
6. **D5 nesting** is listed as provisional in two places (14.1 and a "D5 (part)" row in 14.2). Reference it from one place.

## Suggested review order

1. Q1, Q2, Q4 (small and independent; unblock Unit 1 and Unit 2).
2. Q3, then N1–N4 (these shape the build scaffold).
3. Q5 (before Unit 3).
4. Q10, N5 (when CI is created), Q11 (when 14.52 ships).
5. N6, N7 (when convenient).
